	<h1 id="green">Christmas Tree</h1>
	<img src="Traditions\tree.png" alt="logo"/>
    <pre> The tradition of having an evergreen tree become a symbol of Christmas goes back past recorded written 
	history. 
	
	The Druids in ancient England & Gual and the Romans in Europe both used evergreen branches to 
	decorate their homes and public buildings to celebrate the Winter Solstice. Over the years, 
	these traditions were adopted by Christians, who incorporated them as part of their Christmas 
	holiday celebration.

	Trees used specifically to celebrate Christmas are mentioned in the early 1600's in Germany and 
	surrounding countries. The families would set up these trees in a prominent location of their home 
	and decorate them with colored paper, small toys, food, and sometimes candles. As these people moved 
	or immigrated to other countries, they brought this tradition with them.

	Through the years many different things were used to decorate Christmas trees. As the world moved into 
	the 1900's, many trees were decorated with strings of popcorn, homemade cards and pictures, cotton to 
	look like snow, candy in all shapes and sizes, and occasionally, fancy store made glass balls and hand 
	blown glass figurines. Candles were sometimes used, but often caused devastating fires, and many 
	different types of candle holders were devised to try to prevent tree fires. Electric tree lights were first
	used just 3 years after Thomas Edison has his first mass public demonstration of electric lights back in
	1879. The early Christmas tree lights were handmade and quite expensive.

	Today, Christmas tree ornaments can be found in nearly every size, color, and shape imaginable, and they
	are used to decorate the millions of Christmas trees used throughout the world.</pre>

	<h1 id="green">Christmas Lights</h1>
	<img src="Traditions\lights.png" alt="logo"/>
    <pre> Christmas lights at one time were candles, chosen because their twinkling appearance reminded families 
	of the twinkling of moon light through the branches of fir trees in the forest. Despite the safety 
	precautions taken by these early Christmas light users, mixing live flame with highly flammable Christmas 
	trees resulted in a very dangerous situation and many fires resulted.

	When Thomas Edison invented the first light bulbs in the late 1800’s, it was only a short time before 
	people were putting them on their Christmas trees. These Christmas tree lights soon were being produced 
	and displayed in colors, but only for the very wealthy families, since this new product was very expensive!

	Mass production techniques soon lowered the price of these holiday decorations to the point where 
	average families could afford them. At the same time, the design and complexity of these Christmas lights 
	was also changing. Instead of needing to have each light individually wired, the lights were created with 
	spiral bases to screw into the light sockets on the Christmas tree light strings. This made them easy
	enough for the average family to use and soon these lights decorated windows, doors, and even the 
	outside of homes as well as the Christmas trees. </pre>

	<h1 id="green">Christmas Cards</h1>
	<img src="Traditions\card.png" alt="logo"/>
    <pre> In the days before Christmas cards, many families would send each other letters that shared family news, 
	stories and adventures. For the average family, writing and receiving letters was a major event (since this
	was before the age of the Internet, TV, telephones, and even reliable postal delivery).

	Early Christmas cards were hand drawn or painted by the sender and highly valued by the recipient. They 
	took a long time to create and each one was unique. Printers began to duplicate the original Christmas 
	card pictures and print them in quantity as the custom spread.

	The tradition of exchanging Christmas cards spread throughout the world and soon millions of people 
	were sending and receiving Christmas cards. Today, the variety of Christmas cards is nearly unlimited, 
	including, (going full circle back to the early Christmas cards), many people who today design, create, and
	print their own unique Christmas cards with their home computers and color printers. </pre>

	<h1 id="green">Christmas Gifting</h1>
	<img src="Traditions\gift.png" alt="logo"/>
    <pre> The idea of presenting people you love with gifts is as old as the human race. The idea of exchanging gifts 
	at Christmas time originated with the birth of Jesus, when three wise men traveled to deliver gifts of gold, 
	frankincense, and myrrh to the newborn baby. Shepherds in the fields also came to give gifts to the 
	newborn baby Jesus.

	Everything changed when Clement Clarke Moore wrote the story/poem T’was the night before Christmas in 1822. 
	This story quickly became the most popular poem throughout the world, and children learned in it that Santa 
	Claus brought gifts on Christmas Eve, and they started expecting Santa to bring them gifts as well. Children 
	especially would look for gifts in their stockings hung up to dry by the fireplace.

	Today, the tradition of giving and receiving gifts is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree, candy 
	canes, and Christmas songs. </pre>

	<h1 id="green">Christmas Stockings</h1>
	<img src="Traditions\stocking.png" alt="logo"/>
    <pre> Christmas Stockings Many families will hang large brightly colored Christmas stockings over the fireplace 
	or on the walls of their homes during Christmastime in the hopes that Santa Claus will fill them with toys, 
	treats, and goodies. In fact, families have been hanging stockings for as long as there have been stockings!

	It’s hard for kids to understand today, but for many hundreds of years, most people only had one or two 
	suits of clothing to wear. When their cloths were dirty, they would be washed and then hung up (hopefully 
	near a fire) to dry.  Non-essential clothing, such as socks and gloves were especially valuable and a child 
	was unlikely to have more than one pair and was expected to take good care of that one!

	If a parent wanted to “hide” a treat (such as a small piece of candy) where they were sure it would be 
	found, they would put it in a child’s stocking and it would be found the next morning. 
	
	Eventually, it became a general tradition that Christmas gifts were left in the stockings hung up on 
	Christmas Eve. Any parent who has a child can easily understand that the kids figured out that if they 
	hung bigger stockings, they might get bigger or more treats, so the size of the stockings grew with each
	passing Christmas. Even when the families celebrating Christmas grew wealthy enough that they exchanged 
	larger boxed presents, the tradition of hanging up stockings continued (as did the warning that if you 
	were not well behaved, you might not get any presents – just a lump of coal in your stocking).</pre>

	<h1 id="green">Santas Reindeer</h1>
	<img src="Traditions\reindeer.png" alt="logo"/>
    <pre> Reindeer made good animals to have become a part of this legend, since they lived in very cold northern 
	climates and were therefore unfamiliar to most people in the world. Reindeer can grow up to 6 feet long 
	and about 3 feet high with wide hoofs that spread, allowing them to walk on snow by spreading their 
	weight over a larger area. Their antlers and short legs give them a distinct look.Reindeer have been 
	domesticated and have been used for centuries to pull loads on sleds in snowy regions.

	Ordinary and flying reindeer are common symbols associated with Christmas because of the association 
	with Santa Claus. This legend of eight flying reindeer most likely originated and was made popular by the 
	poem "Twas the Night Before Christmas" by Clement Clarke Moore. </pre>
